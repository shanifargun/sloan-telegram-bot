I have a dataset available here: [link to data]

Please build a Streamlit dashboard to analyze this data.

For reference, here are:

A previously built dashboard: [link to dashboard]

A template EDA (notebook converted to py file): [link to EDA]

Requirements:

- Analyze the dataset thoroughly, make sure to know the column names.

- Analyze the reference codes thoroughly. Multiple analysis steps will be needed FOR EACH REFERENCE FILE.

- Reproduce all visualizations from the template EDA Python file in the dashboard.

- Add any additional visualizations or insights you think would be valuable to a user.

- You do not need to include export-to-Excel or PDF features.

- Maintain a clean, user-friendly UI.

- Ensure the code is well-commented and organized.

- Because this will be a large project, please develop the code in steps to avoid timeouts. If it times out, reduce the size of the steps.
